Reading solute configuration
Reading solvent configuration

Initialising inter-atomic distances...
Generating solvent configuration
Will generate new solvent configuration of 9x9x3 boxes
Solvent box contains 82361 atoms in 82361 residues
Removed 10003 solvent atoms due to solvent-solvent overlap
Removed 18071 solvent atoms due to solute-solvent overlap
Sorting configuration
Found 1 molecule type:
      W (   1 atoms): 54287 residues
Generated solvent containing 54287 atoms in 54287 residues
Writing generated configuration to solvated.gro

Output configuration contains 75791 atoms in 56079 residues
Volume                 :        9000 (nm^3)
