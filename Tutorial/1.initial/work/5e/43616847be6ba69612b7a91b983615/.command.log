Initialising inter-atomic distances...

WARNING: Masses and atomic (Van der Waals) radii will be guessed
         based on residue and atom names, since they could not be
         definitively assigned from the information in your input
         files. These guessed numbers might deviate from the mass
         and radius of the atom type. Please check the output
         files if necessary. Note, that this functionality may
         be removed in a future GROMACS version. Please, consider
         using another file format for your input.

NOTE: From version 5.0 gmx solvate uses the Van der Waals radii
from the source below. This means the results may be different
compared to previous GROMACS versions.

Generating solvent configuration
Will generate new solvent configuration of 9x9x3 boxes
Solvent box contains 82361 atoms in 82361 residues
Removed 10003 solvent atoms due to solvent-solvent overlap
Removed 18105 solvent atoms due to solute-solvent overlap
Sorting configuration
Found 1 molecule type:
      W (   1 atoms): 54253 residues
Generated solvent containing 54253 atoms in 54253 residues
Writing generated configuration to solvated.gro

Output configuration contains 75757 atoms in 56045 residues
Volume                 :        9000 (nm^3)

Processing topology

Back Off! I just backed up topol.top to ./#topol.top.1#

GROMACS reminds you: "Contemplating answers that could break my bonds." (Peter Hammill)

Adding line for 54253 solvent molecules with resname (W) to topology file (topol.top)
