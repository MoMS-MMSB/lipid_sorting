vesicle will be made 
--> Generating molecule types from  generate.str  file
--> Note: the lipids will be generated from < Martini Map CG> Lipid Library, of version:  Martini 3
--> This library contains 128 lipid types 
--> Note: the total upper monolayer area is 691.15 and the total lower monolayer area is 565.487
 now is time to add the lipids
