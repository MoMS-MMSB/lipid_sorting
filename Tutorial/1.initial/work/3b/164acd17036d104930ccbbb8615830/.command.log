Determining Verlet buffer for a tolerance of 0.005 kJ/mol/ps at 310 K

Calculated rlist for 1x1 atom pair-list as 1.102 nm, buffer size 0.002 nm

Set rlist, assuming 4x4 atom pair-list, to 1.100 nm, buffer size 0.000 nm

Note that mdrun will redetermine rlist based on the actual pair-list setup

This run will generate roughly 2 Mb of data

NOTE: The number of threads is not equal to the number of (logical) cpus
      and the -pin option is set to auto: will not pin threads to cpus.
      This can lead to significant performance degradation.
      Consider using -pin on (and -pinoffset in case you run multiple jobs).
