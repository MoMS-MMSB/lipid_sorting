NOTE 1 [file em.mdp, line 43]:
  For proper sampling of the (nearly) decoupled state, stochastic dynamics
  should be used

Number of degrees of freedom in T-Coupling group rest is 64509.00

NOTE 2 [file em.mdp]:
  You are using a plain Coulomb cut-off, which might produce artifacts.
  You might want to consider using PME electrostatics.

NOTE: The number of threads is not equal to the number of (logical) cpus
      and the -pin option is set to auto: will not pin threads to cpus.
      This can lead to significant performance degradation.
      Consider using -pin on (and -pinoffset in case you run multiple jobs).
